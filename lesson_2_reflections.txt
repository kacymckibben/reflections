What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the repository. If you don’t run it, it’s just a regular folder. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as the go-between between the working directory and the repository. This allows you to better organize your commits.
